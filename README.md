# ContextEngineer

A Python package for optimizing context management in large language models through token budgeting and dynamic context optimization.

## Features

- **Token Budget Management**: Intelligent allocation of tokens across context buckets
- **Dynamic Context Optimization**: Select, compress, and reorder information to maximize relevance
- **Position-Aware Assembly**: Mitigate "Lost in the Middle" effect through strategic placement
- **Multiple Compression Strategies**: Extractive, abstractive, and signature-only compression
- **Policy-Based Configuration**: Task-specific optimization strategies
- **Extensible Architecture**: Custom tokenizers, compressors, and policies

## Installation

```bash
pip install context-engineer
```

For development with all optional dependencies:
```bash
pip install context-engineer[all]
```

## Quick Start

```python
from context_engineer import BudgetManager, ContextAssembler, TokenizerService, Compressor
from context_engineer.config.settings import get_default_config

# Load default configuration
config = get_default_config()

# Initialize components
tokenizer = TokenizerService()
budget_manager = BudgetManager(tokenizer)
compressor = Compressor(tokenizer)
assembler = ContextAssembler(tokenizer, compressor)

# Configure buckets from config
budget_manager.configure_buckets(config.buckets)

# Define content sections
content_sections = {
    "system": "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    "task": "Help the user with their question.",
    "history": "Previous conversation about weather patterns.",
    "rag": "Retrieved information about current weather conditions."
}

# Allocate budget
allocations = budget_manager.allocate_budget(
    model_context_limit=8000,
    output_budget=1200,
    content_scores={"system": 1.0, "task": 0.9, "history": 0.6, "rag": 0.8}
)

# Assemble context
result = assembler.assemble_context(
    content_sections=content_sections,
    budget_allocations=allocations,
    placement_policy=config.get_default_policy().placement,
    bucket_configs=config.buckets
)

print(f"Assembled context: {result.total_tokens} tokens")
print(f"Sections: {[s.name for s in result.sections]}")
```

## Define Content Sections

Each section type serves a specific purpose in the context architecture. Here's a comprehensive example showing detailed content for each section type:

# Content scores for relevance weighting
content_scores = {
    "system": 1.0,      # Critical - defines assistant behavior
    "task": 0.95,       # High - current user objective
    "history": 0.7,     # Medium - useful context
    "tools": 0.8,       # High - enables functionality
    "memory": 0.75,     # Medium-High - personalization
    "rag": 0.85,        # High - external knowledge

}
```

### Section Type Descriptions

| Section | Purpose | Content Type | Compression Strategy |
|---------|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **system** | Core instructions and behavioral constraints | Role definitions, safety guidelines, output format requirements | Sticky (never dropped), minimal compression |
| **task** | Current user request and objectives | Questions, commands, analysis requests, specific requirements | Sticky (high priority), task-focused |
| **history** | Previous conversation context | Past interactions, established facts, user feedback | Task summary compression for long conversations |
| **tools** | Available functions and capabilities | Function signatures, API documentation, usage examples | Signature-only compression for code/tools |
| **memory** | Persistent user preferences and facts | User profile, preferences, recurring patterns | Selective inclusion based on relevance |
| **rag** | External retrieved information | Documents, data sources, research findings | Extractive compression with relevance ranking |
| **fewshot** | Example interactions | Q&A pairs, demonstration examples | Truncate or remove if space limited |
| **scratchpad** | Working memory and calculations | Intermediate results, reasoning steps | Tail placement, first to compress/drop |

### Content Score Guidelines

- **1.0**: Critical information (system instructions, safety constraints)
- **0.8-0.95**: High importance (current task, essential tools, key data)
- **0.6-0.8**: Medium importance (relevant history, useful context)
- **0.3-0.6**: Low importance (examples, supplementary info)
- **0.0-0.3**: Optional information (scratchpad, non-essential examples)

### Compression Strategy Selection

Choose compression methods based on content type:

- **`signature_only`**: For tools/APIs - keeps function signatures
- **`task_summary`**: For conversations - extracts key points
- **`extractive`**: For documents - pulls key sentences
- **`abstractive`**: For long texts - generates summaries
- **`truncate`**: For simple content - basic length reduction

### Best Practices

1. **Keep system instructions concise but comprehensive**
2. **Make task descriptions specific and actionable**
3. **Include relevant context in history, not just chronology**
4. **Structure tool documentation for easy parsing**
5. **Focus memory on actionable preferences, not biographical data**
6. **Curate RAG content for relevance and credibility**
7. **Use fewshot examples that represent desired interaction patterns**
8. **Keep scratchpad focused on current task progress**

## Architecture

The package implements the token budgeting algorithm from the ContextEngineer specification:

1. **8-Bucket System**: Context is divided into semantic buckets (System, Task, Tools, History, Memory, RAG, Few-shot, Scratchpad)
2. **Token Budgeting**: Proportional allocation with minimum/maximum constraints
3. **Dynamic Optimization**: ROI-based allocation using content relevance scores
4. **Position Strategy**: Head/Middle/Tail placement to avoid "Lost in the Middle"

## Core Components

### TokenizerService
Unified tokenization supporting multiple backends (simple regex-based, tiktoken).

### BudgetManager
Token allocation across context buckets with fallback strategies.

### ContextAssembler
Position-aware context assembly with compression support.

### Compressor
Multiple compression strategies: truncate, extractive, abstractive, signature-only.

### PolicyEngine
Task-specific optimization policies (research, code generation, conversation, etc.).

## Configuration

The package supports YAML/JSON configuration files:

```yaml
